This project is dedicated to benchmarking some of the most popular NoSQL databases, including Redis, MongoDB and Cassandra, using the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB).


## Overview

*YCSB* is an open-source benchmarking tool created by Yahoo! to assess the performance of various NoSQL databases. It provides a standardized framework for testing the scalability and performance of different data stores under realistic workloads. This project mainly uses a *products* table and aach product in this table contains essential information, including its name, price, availability, description and category. Three distinct workloads were defined to assess different database scenarios.

In this repository, we focus on benchmarking three prominent NoSQL databases:
- [Redis](https://redis.io): an in-memory data store used for caching and high-speed data access;
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com): a powerful document-oriented database known for its flexibility and scalability;
- [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html): a distributed, fault-tolerance, highly available and scalable NoSQL database designed for handling large amounts of data.


## Table Structure

- The *products* table represents a simplified e-commerce product catalog, with the following schema:
    - Name: the name of the product;
    - Price: the price of the product;
    - Availability: whether the product is in stock (true/false);
    - Description: a brief description of the product;
    - Category: the category or type of the product.

- Workloads:

    - Read-heavy Workload (65% Read, 30% Scan, 5% Update): this workload simulates scenarios where users browse product information, customer reviews or order history; it focuses predominantly on read operations, suggesting that the system needs to efficiently handle a large volume of read requests, ensuring fast and reliable access, and scan operations, indicating the need for retrieving a range of data such as searching for items based on specific criteria; moreover, it also includes occasional updates to product attributes.
    - Updates-intensive Workload (80% Update, 10% Read, 10% Read-Modify-Write): this workload reproduces tasks such as processing customer orders, updating inventory levels or managin product details; given the high proportion of update operations, the system needs to efficiently handle a significant number of requests to modify existing (like updating stock levels, tracking order status, editing prices), on the other hand the small proportion of read operations could indicate users that browse information or reviews, whilst the small proportion of read-modify-write operations indicates scenarios where data needs to be retrieved, modified and then written back to the database.
    - Insert-intensive Workload (70% insert, 15% Read, 15% Update): this workload simulates scenarios where existing data are retrieved and modified or new information is added to the database; the majority of insert operations suggests a focus on adding new data (like new customer registrations, new products to the catalog, new reviews), the read operations involve recovering data (for example, customer reviews, personalized contents) while the small proportion of update operations suggests the need for modifying existing data such as updating customer profiles, adjusting product quantities.

## Key Features

- Benchmarking Configurations: we provide pre-configured YCSB benchmarking scenarios for Redis, MongoDB and Cassandra. These configurations are designed to simulate real-world use cases and can be easily customized to fit your specific requirements.
- Performance Metrics: track essential performance metrics such as throughput, latency and resource utilization for each database during benchmarking.
- Comprehensive Documentation: our repository includes detailed documentation on how to set up, configure and run YCSB benchmarks for Redis, MongoDB and Cassandra.


## Getting Started

### 1. Start DB instance
You can also run a Docker container. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a containerization platform that allows you to run applications, including databases, in isolated environments called containers. 

### 2. Install Java and Maven
YCSB requires the use of Maven 3; if you use Maven 2, you may see [errors such as these](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/issues/406).

### 3. Set Up YCSB
Download the [latest release of ycsb_NGDB](https://github.com/ChriAsc/ycsb_NGDB/releases):

    git clone https://github.com/ChriAsc/ycsb_NGDB
    cd ycsb_NGDB
    
    
### 4. Building from source
Set up a database to benchmark. There is a README file under each binding directory.

To build the full distribution, with all database bindings:

    mvn clean package

To build a single database binding:

    mvn -pl site.ycsb:DB-binding -am clean package
    
<sub>*Replace "DB" with database name, e.g. "redis"*</sub>

### 5. Run YCSB command
You can provide DB Connection Parameters or set configs with the shell command.

    On Linux:
    bin/ycsb.sh load redis -s -P workloads/workloada -p "redis.host=127.0.0.1" -p "redis.port=6379" > outputLoad.txt
    bin/ycsb.sh run  redis -s -P workloads/workloada -p "redis.host=127.0.0.1" -p "redis.port=6379" > outputRun.txt

    
    On Windows:
    bin/ycsb.bat load redis -s -P workloads/workloada -p "redis.host=127.0.0.1" -p "redis.port=6379" > outputLoad.txt
    bin/ycsb.bat run  redis -s -P workloads/workloada -p "redis.host=127.0.0.1" -p "redis.port=6379" > outputRun.txt

  <sub>Running the `ycsb` command without any argument will print the usage</sub>
   
Alternatively, you can use the python script `tests.py`, which allows you to load and run all databases.

However, raw results are stored as .csv files and have a well-defined structure: the first part shows the operation, the associated timestamp and latency (as many rows as the number of operations/records); the second part (approximately the last 60 rows) gives aggregate measurements.
